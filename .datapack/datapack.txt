This is the modification file, you can use this to modify the default values.
easy_num is the numbers given in easy mode.
mid_num and high_num is the same as above.
mid_tries is the max number of times you can get corrected in "medium" game mode. You can type -1, for infinite trials.
"---" to end the mod file, you can type anything after it (comments)

any *_num value above 20 makes the program a bit slower

also dont forget to save this file and re-initialise the virtual machine!
